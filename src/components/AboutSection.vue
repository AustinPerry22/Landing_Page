            Welcome to my website! I'm Austin, a full-stack software developer. I have taken courses in computer science while earning my associates in S.T.E.M. at the College of Western Idaho.  Additionally, I successfully completed the Immersive Full Stack web development course at Boise Codeworks.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy diving into projects and acquiring new skills. Beyond software development, you'll find me immersed in video games, movies, playing ping pong, or enjoying the company of my cat.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm excited to work with a team, eager to learn, and looking forward to the growing as as software developer and as a person.
        </p>
